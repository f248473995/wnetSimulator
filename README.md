Basic Wireless network simulator (Matlab)
There are a lot of network simulation tools available on internet but very less simlation tutorial available based on Matlab.The purpose of this repo is to provide a easy to use Matlab simulation network framework for various research based on Wireless Networks.

## Some Network Simulators
Here's a list of network simulators tools (Open Source).

Name | Language | 
:-- | --: | --: | --:
Omnet++ | C++
ns2 | C++
ns3 | C++
Omnet++ | C++
Simulink 


## Why Matlab ?
Matlab in not only a programming language, but a programming environment as well.
You can perform operations from the command line, as a sophisticated calculator.
Or you can create programs and functions that perform repetitive tasks, just as any other computer language.

### Matlab network simulation 
Wireless networks , Sensor networks , Cognitive radio networks are some of the domains where matlab can be used to perfrom simulation.
